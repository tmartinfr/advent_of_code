One food per line, followed by ingredients, and all or some allergens it
contains

Each allergen is found in exactly one ingredient

Each ingredient contains zero or one allergen

Allergens are not always marked for a given food

If an allergen is listed, the corresponding ingredient is somewhere in the
food list

TODO find ingredients which cannot contain any of the allergens

For each food
For each allergen, one of the ingredients contains it

For each ingredients, we can check if it can't match one of the allergen on the
same line : for each allergen, if there is another line with only this
allergen somewhere else, then the ingredient must be on this line too : if
not, it means the ingredient doesnt't contain the allergen

Needed data structures :

- List with tuples containing ingredient list and set of allergen list
- Hash with allergen as key (when this allergen is alone on its line) and a set of the corresponding ingredients as value
- Counter of each ingredient in the menu
- Hash of ingrediens with their possible allergens
